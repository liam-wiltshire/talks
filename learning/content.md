# Learning to Learn
## Supercharging Your Knowledge

.reference[Becris - flaticon.com/authors/becris]

???

- From the moment we're born, we're learning. Be that learning how the world around us works, how to stack blocks or how to read and write, it's an ongoing, lifelong process.
- Learning has so many benifits - some obvious, but many less so
- If we can maximise our learning, making it efficient and effective, learning can be our superpower.

# Learning to Learn
## Supercharging Your Knowledge

.reference[Becris - flaticon.com/authors/becris]

???

- Before I go on, I just want to say, it's so difficult to arrange an event like this
- Especially with the challenges of the past few years - it's brilliant to finally be able to meet with everyone face-to-face, share ideas
- So many people are needed to make these things happens - organisers, sponsors, technical and more
- So from me, a personal thank you
- If you get an opportunity to speak to any of the organisers in the hangouts, let them know how much you appreciate it, and also provide feedback

- So, who am I?

???

- Last year, talk on impostor syndrome, mentioned using impostor syndrome as a superpower - desire to continually improve skills
- If we are always learning, and can find ways to learn effectively, we gain a whole range of benefits

???
- higher levels of eudaimonia (You-deh-monia) wellbeing (well-being, happiness and flourishing), hedonic wellbeing, and reduced psychological stress
  - no studies have found a negative impact on wellbeing
- High wellbeing directly relates to good health and longevity
- Another study in the UK (Aldridge, F & Lavender, P, 2020) found that, in their study 87 percent of respondents reported benefits to their physical health and 89 percent felt they had experienced positive emotional or mental health benefits from learning.

# Improved Confidence and Sense of Self

.highres[![](learning/images/happy.png)]

.bottomright[.xsmall[Currie, K. 2008]]
.reference[Human Vectors by Vecteezy (vecteezy.com/free-vector/human)]

???
- Multiple studies have found that the achivement felt when learning a new skill, or leveling up an existing skill helps improve confidence and self-belief
 - This then feeds back into how learning can help our mental health - combating impostor syndrome and increasing our self-worth.
- The impact of the past few years has been profound - leaving many feeling unmotivated, struggling to find purpose or direction
 - There is much that we cannot control, even in our own environment. However if we make the most of what we can control - and learning can be a part of this - we can jump-start our passion and motivation, even with just some small successes
- Learning can help us shape our own lives and re-enforce our self-confidence and sense of self-worth and confidence. Improving our self view and self esteem are significant factors in combatting many mental-health issues, and learning is one way to do this.

# Strengthen Your Brain
<br />
.highres[![](learning/images/brain-flat.png)]

.bottomright[.xsmall[Klemm, W. 2000]]

???

- It sounds cliche, but brain exercise. Studies, such as one done by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in America have shown the learning actually changes the physical structure of the brain
- Learning strenghtens pathways in the brain, improving memory retreval, and information processing amongst other things.

- Of course, there are other benifits too - adding more skills makes you potentially more flexible, increase job opportunities etc, but that's not what I'm focusing on right now

# That's All Great, But....
.highres[![](learning/images/angry.png)]


.reference[Human Vectors by Vecteezy (vecteezy.com/free-vector/human)]

???

- Ok, so there are loads of really good reasons _to_ spend some time learning
- But, there are also lots of reasons not to:
  - Ask for suggestions
  - Not enough time (too busy)
  - Flat out at work, so just want to relax when I get home
  - I don't know what to learn
  - I don't know _how_ to learn
- These are all legit reasons, but as with most things in life, there is never a 'right' time to do anything, there is just the 'now' time
- During the rest of this talk, we're going to aim to dispell some of these reasons, maximise your learning opportunities, even if it's just 15 minutes, and get you to love learning!

# How Do You Learn?

.reference[Human Vectors by Vecteezy (vecteezy.com/free-vector/human)]

- It's not easy! But this is the problem - to really maximise our learning opportunities, particularly if we don't have much time, we need to understand _how_ we learn so we can make sure we make the most of it

# Steps To Learning
.highres[![](learning/images/idea.png)]

class: content-even

# Steps To Learning

- Motivation
- Retention
- Application

???

- Learning can be broken down into three parts in a loop.
- Firstly Motivation - this is often the hardest part, as getting started, when there are many barriers (real and constructed) that get in the way
  - Once you start, continuing often gets much easier
- Once you start, you need to remember what you've learned - learning and memory are actually very closely related, so understanding how you can maximise memory retention will help you learn much quicker
- Finally, once you can retrieve what you've learned, you need to know how to apply it

- The good thing is that this loop becomes a flywheel:

---

class: content-even center middle

![](learning/images/flywheel.png)

???

- By learning something, you'll often experience a sense of achievement which makes it easier to motivate to learn the next thing
- By being able to apply what you've already learned, identifying patterns and rules, it is easier to learn and retain related information in the next cycle, which results in a greater sense of achievement "how quickly did I learn that?!", more motivation etc!
- So let's address these on at a time:

class: section-title-b center

# Motivation
.highres[![](learning/images/battle.png)]
---
class: summary-slide middle

"Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. It is what causes you to act, whether it is getting a glass of water to reduce thirst or reading a book to gain knowledge.

Motivation involves the biological, emotional, social, and cognitive forces that activate behavior. In everyday usage ... is ... used to describe why a person does something. It is the driving force behind human actions."
.xsmall[Cherry, K. 2022]

???

- "Read quote"
  - This gives us a good starting point on how motiviation is created

---
class: summary-slide middle

"Motivation is the process that initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented behaviors. It is what causes you to act, whether it is getting a glass of water to reduce thirst or reading a book to gain knowledge.

Motivation involves the **biological, emotional, social, and cognitive** forces that activate behavior. In everyday usage ... is ... used to describe why a person does something. It is the driving force behind human actions."
.xsmall[Cherry, K. 2022]

???

- "Biological, emotional, social and congnitive"
 - Not all of these will apply at the same time:
 - Biological is more apparent in "survival situations" - feeling thirsty because you need hydration, etc
 - Emotional motivation is powerful - as much as we might see ourselves as logical beings (cognitive forces), emotions often overpower this:
  - I am currently trying to lose weight - 3.5kgs and counting! As much as the reason for this _should_ be that I know that currently I am at risk of various illnesses, heart issues and potentially even early death, my motivation is actually that when I went on holiday at the start of August, I wouldn't go to the beach unless I was wearing a top, even in the sea - the emotional driver is more powerful than the logical one, although both are important

.xsmall[Cherry, K. 2022]

???

- Social is a double edged sword - on the one hand we shouldn't be comparing ourselves to others - anyone who has seen my Impostor Syndrome talk knows this is a major trigger of IS
 - However at the same time, if you are looking for that promotion, or you feel that someone you know has skills in an area that you'd like to find out more about, that can be a powerful motivator
 - It's important in this situation to try to remain as objective as possible - recognise your strengths, realise that it's ok to want to improve your skills in an area, but that doesn't mean that you don't bring your own value in other areas
 - If this sounds familiar to anyone who has experienced IS, that's because it is - we'll touch upon that again a little later!

# Motivators

- Create small, daily or weekly goals (emotional)
- Join interest groups, online or offline (social)
- Define your "Why" (emotional, cognitive)
- Create a learning routine (cognitive)

???

- These are just a few ideas for how you can create motiviation - I'm sure you can think of millions more!

- Create small, daily or weekly goals (emotional)
   - By creating mini goals that are achivable, you will firstly be able to track your progress, which will help silence the doubts that will inevitability creep in, but also that sense of achievement will motivate you to hit the next target. Consider attaching a little reward to each goal - a trip to your favour ice-cream place, an extra hour in bed, or that new DLC you've been dying to try out!
- Join interest groups, online or offline (social)
   - By participaing in groups, you can both re-affirm your own learning by helping others that are just starting out (more on this later), but also get inspiration from others that perhaps have been learning a subject for years and know far more about it! If you feel comfortable, consider sharing your learning goals to help you add accountability to hitting them?

# Motivators

- Create small, daily or weekly goals (emotional)
- Join interest groups, online or offline (social)
- Define your "Why" (emotional, cognitive)
- Create a learning routine (cognitive)

???

- Define your "Why" (emotional, cognitive)
  - When trying to learn about something new, spend some time deciding **why** - this needs to be strong, and connected to you emotionally - "because it's good for me", or "because I probably should know it" isn't going to cut it!! If your why is instead attached to an emotion such as happiness, love or fulfilment, you are much more likely to invest the time, particularly if you keep reminding yourself of that why.
- Create a learning routine (cognitive)
  - Creating good habits is hard, but once you have a routine or habit, it's much easier to keep at it. It might just be that you schedule 30 minutes, twice a week where you will be in the same place (we'll talk about how you maximise that 30 minutes later) - by sticking to the same schedule, you will form a habit over time which makes spending that time on learning the "default"
  - It is important however to make sure it doesn't become "robotic" - so make sure you are still keeping your "Why" in mind, and mix up _how_ you learn to keep it interesting

# Retention
.highres[![](learning/images/thought.png)]

---

class: summary-slide middle

"Learning and memory are closely related concepts. Learning is the acquisition of skill or knowledge, while memory is the expression of what you’ve acquired" .xsmall[Kazdin, A (Ed.) 2000]
???

- The relationship between learning and memory is incredibly close and intertwined.
- It is almost impossible for an individual to truly learn something without also having the memory to retain what they have learned, although learning also concerns with the application of that knowledge, which we will consider later - but still requires memory


---

class: content-even middle center

# Think About Your Most Powerful Memory

???

- Does anyone feel comfortable sharing a powerful memory?
 - Tell me as much as possible about it
- If not
 - For many years, I've gone on vacation to the same place - Swanage
 - I can feel, standing here, like I am on the seafront - I can *hear* the sounds from the arcades over my right shoulder
  - I can *smell* the town - salty
  - I can *feel* the sand - slightly more corse than some places - under my feet

# Think About Your Most Powerful Memory

- Strongest memories invoke multiple senses<br />.xsmall[Quak M, London R, Talsma D, 2015]
- Similar concepts apply to learning .xsmall[Willis, J, 2008]

???

- Many of the strongest memories have multiple senses - our brain can use multiple pathways to unlock the memory, and multiple pieces of information combined to make it strong
- A similar concept applies to learning - by using multiple parts of our brain to rehearse the information, we create multiple pathways, and different interpretations of the same information to make recalling it easier
  - For example you might listen to an audio book, read a transcription, then print it out and hand-write notes on it - by using these multiple methods, you are procesing the information in different ways
  - This is one of the reasons if I am learning a new subject I still hunt out physical books as well as digital resources - I can write on it, make notes, highlight, underline etc, interacting with it in a way not possible with digital media.
- You could take this even further - I'm sure at school you might have had rhymes or songs to remember certain things - this is using yet another part of the brain

# Teach Others

.withtitle[.smallish[- Teach something you've learned to someone else
- Explaining concepts to another person is a different way of learning - the more methods you use, the more effective it will be]]

.left[![](learning/images/teaching.png)]

???

- Explaining new concepts is a common method of consolidating and internalizing learning, as well as proving to yourself that you have learned this new topic at the same time!
- The person you are explaning it to may then have other questions, which force you to think about what you've learned in different ways, or highlight the next area you might focus on
- In addition, successfully sharing knowledge with others can help increase your motivation to learn more

# Learn By Doing

- When you were at school, alot of your learning was probably reading textbooks, or listening to lectures
- Being more active in your learning - learning by doing - has been proven to be more effective than traditional learning techniques .xsmall[Madariaga, M et al. 2006] 

???

- Put your hand up if you learned to ride a bike or swim as a child
   - Keep your hands up if you can still remember how - even if you are a bit rusty
- Ok, now put your hand up if you were taught about quadratic equasions at school
   - And who can still remember and apply that?
- Skills that you develop by doing are better ingraned in your memory, and retrival is easier, even a long time in the future
   - Your memoeries of quadratic equations are probably still in there somewhere - if I showed this:

class: content-odd center middle

![](learning/images/quadratic.png)

???

- Some of you might have some recollection, but it's probably still no-where near as clear as knowing how to ride a bike!

- You've probably noticed that all of these are essentially making your brain process information in different ways!

---

class: section-title-a center

# Application
.highres[![](learning/images/computer.png)]

???

- So you've found your motivation, you've maximised your mental pathways -what now?
- The real value in learning is being able to apply what you've learned - this is the application (or implementation) step

---

class: content-odd

# Application

- It's unlikely that you will always just repeat the things you've learned word-for-word
- Being able to apply what you've learned to different situations will let you get the most out of your learning
- This is where you convert 'knowledge' into 'skills'
- It's important to assess the effectiveness of this application step

???

- We've already talked a little about applying what you learn - teaching others and learning by going are two ways to take your theoretical knowledge and use it
- However, how do you know if you are using it correctly?

---

class: content-odd

# Application

- Get out there
- Find a learning buddy
- Be assessed
- Mind the gaps
  
???

- Get out there
  - Find an opportunity to use your skills (be that on a voluntary basis or as part of your job), in a situation where someone with more experience is there to guide you
- Find a learning buddy
  - Find someone, perhaps from your learning group who is going through the same application step as you, and share ideas, experiences and be accountable to each other
- Be assessed
  - No-one likes being tested, but if you are not confident in your progression, taking an exam, or asking someone with more experience to assess where you are will give you an impartial view on your progress
- Mind the gaps
  - Everyone makes mistakes, and everyone has gaps in their knowledge - that doesn't mean you have failed in your learning - quite the opposite, by identifying any gaps you do have, it gives you an opportunity to learn even more!

# Make the Most of Your Time

.highres[![](learning/images/time.png)]

- Work, friends, family, hobbies, all need our time, energy and attention
- So, if you can only carve out a little time, how can you make the most of it?

# Zone of Proximal Development

> The distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem-solving under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers
.right[.xsmall[Vygotsky, 1978]]


???

- The theory of the Zone of Proximal Development was devised by Lev (Vi - got - ski), to describe how children most efficiently learn.
- While it was originally used with children, it works just as well for adults
- The definition isn't all that clear, so it's easier to think of it in rings:

---

class: content-even center

# Zone of Proximal Development

![](learning/images/zpd.png)

.reference[Carleton College]

???

- In this 'three ring' model, the center are the things you can already do - your existing knowledge and skills
- Your ZPD, the second ring, are thing that you _could_ do, with just a small amount of help - the right learning materials, and individual with more experience guiding you etc
 - It is based on taking your current ability to the next step

---
class: content-even
# Zone of Proximal Development

- Just going through things in your 'ability' circle won't help you learn
- Trying to take _too_ big a leap will make progress very slow and inefficient
- Tackling learning in small 'bites' - just a little outside your current knowledge will enable you to improve quicker

???

- An example of this is learning to read - a child who knows the letters of the alphabet won't gain too much (other than confidence) by repeating the letters of the alphabet over and over.
- They are likewise not going to be able to go from knowing the individual letters to reading war and peace, no matter how much help they get.
- However, with a little bit of guidance and help from a teacher or an older student, could read words like 'dog' or 'cat'.
 - By breaking it up into these small steps, it also means you have regular 'wins', feeding your motivation to learn more - think back to our learning flywheel

# Scaffolding

- Wood and Middleton (1975) wanted to discover _how_ Vygotsky's 'assistance' should be given
- Found there are three main types of assistance:
  - General encouragement
  - Specific instructions
  - Direct demonstration

???

- The study found, somewhat predictably, that the correct type of assistance depended on the ability of the subject
- If the subject was brand new to a topic or idea, then direct demonstration was valuable
- If the subject already had some exposure to the topic or idea, but was still in the learning stage, then instructions were most helpful
- Finally, once the knowledge was acquired and the aim was application, then general encouragement, allowed the subject to process the informaton for themselves
- Just as scaffolding is removed as a building is completed, support should be reduced and removed as knowledge is built.

# Scaffolding

- Wood and Middleton (1975) wanted to discover _how_ Vygotsky's 'assistance' should be given
- Found there are three main types of assistance:
  - General encouragement
  - Specific instructions
  - Direct demonstration

???

- While you might not have someone assessing your progress and providing direct assistance, consider how different learning resources are useful at different stages of learning:
- Watching and Copying a YouTube tutorial step-by-step might be useful the first time, but watching and copying the same tutortial 10 times won't add any further benifit - at that point finding resources that 'deep dive' into specific parts of the process that allow you to understand the underlying knowledge, to eventually be able to apply it in different situations will produce better outcomes.

---

class: content-even

# Be Prepared

- If you only have a short amount of time, avoid wasting it trying to find the right resources or materials
- If you have a set learning time, make sure your learning materials and anything else you need are ready
- Get your coffee, water, energy drink etc beforehand
- Make your 15 minutes of learning 15 solid minutes, assess your progress, then reward yourself for your work

???

---

class: summary-slide

- Effective learning can be your superpower
- Improve your physical, emotional and mental wellbeing
- Learning doesn't have to require huge chunks of time, but it does need dedication
- Getting started is the hardest part, but once you do, make the most of the learning flywheel to keep it going
- Learn smart, not hard
- Good luck, you'll smash it!
