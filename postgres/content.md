# Features

---

class: content-odd
# Partial Indexes

- Indexes can be defined that are only created for rows that meet a certain condition
- For example, if you had a table that used soft delets, then you could index *only* non-deleted rows

---

class: content-odd

```sql
liamwiltshire=> CREATE INDEX page_slugs ON pages  ( slug )
 â†³ WHERE deleted = 0;
 CREATE INDEX
```

---

class: content-even
# Connection Model

- Postgres uses a process per connection model
    - By comparison, mySQL has a single process with multiple threads
- While it does create extra overhad when creating the connection, there are multiple benefits

---

class: content-even
# Connection Model

- Works with *nix tools like ps, top, kill
    - Use the OS to identify/kill individual problem connections
- Processes are isolated from each other
- Concurrency tends to be improved

---

class: content-odd
# Stored Procedures

- Both Postgres and mySQL support stored procedures (stored functions)
- Postgres will let you write them in many languages:
    - SQL, Perl, Python, JavaScript etc.
- mySQL only supports SQL

---

class: content-even
# Expression Indexes

- Postgres will let you create an index based on the result of an expression
- This can then be relied on in queries that would otherwise have to run this (potentially expensive expression at runtime)

---

class: content-even

```sql
CREATE INDEX last_name_lower ON people (lower(last_name));

SELECT * FROM people WHERE
  lower(last_name) = lower('Wiltshire');
```

---

class: content-odd
# Data Types

- Postgres has lots of interesting data types for specific cases:
    - Geometry - point, line, box, polygon, circle.
    - Network - macaddr, cidr, inet
    - UUID
    - Range - int4range, tsrange, daterange
