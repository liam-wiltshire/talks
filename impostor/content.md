# Some Title
## Impostor Syndrome

.reference[InnerSloth innersloth.com]

???

- Start with a story
    - Like all good stories, starts "Once upon a time"
    - Took a job at a digital agency - before I was in gaming
    - Were previously a mobile-app agency, wanted to get into web
    - I was hired to make that possible
    - Build a team, find business, make it profitable
    - I lasted 6 months (and 3 months of that was my notice period)
        - Not because I was fired, or because anything was wrong, and the reason I gave was travel was too far
        - But I actually quit because I thought I was going to be found out
        - That one of the staff I hired, or the directors (who were not technical) would realise that I didn't know what I was talking about
        - I quit because of impostor syndrome

# Some Title
## Impostor Syndrome

.reference[InnerSloth innersloth.com]

???

- Before I go on, I just want to say, it's so difficult to arrange an event like this
- Especially with the challenges of the past 2 years
- So many people are needed to make these things happens - organisers, sponsors, technical and more
- So from me, a personal thank you
- If you get an opportunity to speak to any of the organisers in the hangouts, let them know how much you appreciate it, and also provide feedback

- So, who am I?

# Do I Have (or Have I Had) Impostor Syndrome?
![](impostor/images/question.png)

.reference[Human Vectors by Vecteezy (vecteezy.com/free-vector/human)]

???

- One of the problems with impostor syndrome is that, if you have it you probably don't realise
 - Certainly when I quit that job, I didn't think "Oh, I have impostor syndrome" - I genuinely felt I wasn't good enough

# Do I Have (or Have I Had) Impostor Syndrome?
<br />
# Probably
<br />
<small>Bravata, Watts et. al (2020)</small>

???

- The short answer is, you probably have, (or do).
- A 2020 study found the prevalence of impostor syndrome to be up to 82%
    - this was a Systematic Review, meaning it's a review of other studies, so each one has a different definition, different thresholds for what is considered impostor syndrome etc
    - so it's likely to be lower (other studies suggest around 40-60%), but regardless it's much more common that is often realised

- One of the major challenges is that, sometimes something might actually just be really hard, and you might need help with something, and other times you might have all the skills, knowledge and experience you need, but impostor syndrome is holding you back

# So, What Does Impostor Syndrome Look Like?
![](impostor/images/angry.png)

.reference[Human Vectors by Vecteezy (vecteezy.com/free-vector/human)]

???
- If that's the case, then how does anyone know if they have it?
    - While there have been many studies on Impostor Syndrome, there isn't really one "right answer".
    
- To start, let's look at a definition from one of the initial studies on IS:

---

class: summary-slide middle

"An internal experience of intellectual phonies [who don't] experience an internal sense of success. There are three defining characteristics of IS:

1. The belief that others have an inflated view of your abilities or skills
2. The fear that you will be found out and exposed as a fake
3. The persistent attribution of success to external factors, such as luck" .xsmall[Clance, P. R., & Imes, S. A. (1978)]

???

- That's not very helpful, and is quite a restricted view - as we've said, different individuals will experience it in different ways
- So instead, lets look at some of the experiences of impostor syndrome - the 'symptoms' if you like

- These are either symptoms that I or others I know experienced, or are cited in studies - there are definitely others, but these are some of the most common ones: 

---

class: content-odd center

# Self Doubt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

## "I'm a fake"
## "I'm going to be found out"

???

- Self doubt is probably the most common feeling of Impostor Syndrome
- It's not unusual to be uncertain about something, especially if it's new, or difficult.
- However Self Doubt is usually more intense than that
 - It's often an anxiety-inducing fear, a conviction that you have been faking it the entire time and you one slip-up, or even one sentance away from being found out,


---

class: content-even center

# Inability to assess your own skill levels

## "I blagged the whole thing"
## "If I can do it, anyone can."
## "They're just being nice."

???

- Again sometimes, particularly when we're doing something new, we might genuinely know our skill level isn't high
- However, with impostor syndrome, our perceived skill levels do not match up with our experience, or others views of our skills
 - A belief that people think we're better than we are - often associated with "faking it" from the previous point

---

class: content-odd center

# Attributing your success to external factors

## "I had a lot of help."
## "If it wasn't for <em>x</em>, it would never have happened."

???

- Rarely any success down to a single individual - success is a team sport
- However, for individuals with impostor syndrome, they will often actively seek to play down their contributions, either pointing to others who did the heavy lifting, or looking for external factors to explain it
 - If we hadn't had a discussion about this new tool at that exact moment, it'd never have worked

---
class: content-even center

# Berating your<br />performance

## "Failure is not an option."
## "That was totally my fault."

???

- The inverse of refusing success, people with impostor syndrome might heap all failure on themselves. With everything we do, sometimes things won't go to plan
 - But for someone wth impostor syndrome, it's just proof that they are right and they are not good enough
 - As with success, anything not going to plan is rarely down to a single individual (and almost certainly down to someone with impostor syndrome), but they'll willingly take all the blame, because, honestly, they think they deserve it.

---

class: content-odd center

# Self Sabotage<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;

## "I'm not working on <em>x</em>, I'd just be in the way"
## "There is no point me learning <em>y</em>, I'll never understand it anyway"

???

- Closely tied with the fear of being found out, it makes sense to 'hide in the shadows', and avoid any situation where you might out yourself
- This means that opportunities for advancement/improvment might be avoided
- For me, it got to the point of actively avoiding working at all
    - I'd make excuses why I _had_ to be in that meeting (which I totally didn't), or when I was at my desk, I'd actively avoid doing any work, even though (and probably hoping) that I'd be more likely caught for that than for not being good enough.

# What Should I Do? (To Battle!)
![](impostor/images/battle.png)

.reference[Human Vectors by Vecteezy (vecteezy.com/free-vector/human)]

???

- Unfortunately, even _if_ you suspect you have impostor syndrome (which is hard enough), there certainly isn't a "silver bullet"
 - Understanding _why_ we feel the way we do, what is causing these feelings of fraud is the first step towards addressing it

.withtitle[.xsmall[Cherry, K (2020)]]
.right[![](impostor/images/brain.png)]

.reference[Human Vectors by Vecteezy (vecteezy.com/free-vector/human)]

???

- Impostor Syndrome can be defined as......
  
- Our brains are incredible. At the same time, they can be incredibly stupid
- Every waking minute, our brains are processing thousands of data signals, both internal and external and trying to make sense of it.
- Unfortunately it doesn't always make a good job of it, and once our brain _does_ decide on something, it will often look for patterns and evidence to fit that, even if it means discarding or ignoring other evidence.

.right[![](impostor/images/brain.png)]

.reference[Human Vectors by Vecteezy (vecteezy.com/free-vector/human)]

???

- When you look at this in relation to Impostor syndrome:
    - Systematic Error - our brain keeps telling us, over and over - I'm faking it, I can't do this
    - Processing and Interpreting - think about to what we said about our brain looking at failures as proof - even if there is more evidence of success, our brain will "explain that away" as being because of something else, but will then use failures as proof of our fakery
    - Affecting decisions and judgements - trying to avoid situations where we might be "found out"
- While there are many factors that can go into impostor syndrome, including external influences, this is probably as close to a "smoking gun" as we can get

# Coping Mechanisms
- Refrain from comparison
- Keep a 'success log'
- Ask for support
- Break the cycle

???

- Sometimes, impostor syndrome will just be there - there will be bad days that you just have to survive
- Some of the things I've done (and still do):

- Try to avoid comparing yourself wth others
 - as we've discovered, your brain will exaggerate their successes (and what is perceives as your failures) to fit it's own narrative

- Keep a 'success log'
 - I still keep a notebook with achievements in that have been recognised by my peers as successful - you can then refer to this when you are having a tough day to remind yourself that you have recognised successes that counter-balance the current struggles
  
---
class: content-odd

# Coping Mechanisms
- Refrain from comparison
- Keep a 'success log'
- Ask for support
- Break the cycle

???

- Ask for support
  - Remember how we said success was a team sport? Ask someone you know and trust to help you make some wins - remember your brain might try to pass the wins off as completely down to the other person, so keep note of your contributions as evidence that it was a combined win
- Break the cycle
  - Trying to do something new (or particularly difficult) on a 'survival' day provides your dumb brain with plenty of ammo to remind yourself that you are a fraud - the fact you can't immediately do 'x', which your brain will tell you everyone else can (even though they probably can't), will trigger the cognative bias into overdrive.
  - Do something else - partake in a guilty pleasure, if that's singing in the shower, or a glass of wine in the bath go for it!, or pick up other task that you know will be a 'quick win' to remind you of your successes.

# Retrain Your Brain
- Talk
- Be a mentor
- Assessments
- Learning and Development

???

- While we can survive the difficult days, and surviving those days is an achievement in itself, we can do more
- Our brains love data, and forming patterns in data, so with a little (ok, a lot) of persuading, we can start getting it to think in different ways
- As with anything involving the brain, practice, practice, practice - repetition is vital

- Talk
 - Find a safe space, a support group that you can share with - with Impostor syndrome we often believe we're the only ones - no-one else seems to be strugling, it's just me
 - The reality is that they probably are (remember that statistic at the start), but, like you, they do their best to hide it
 - Sharing experiences, coping mechanisms, and wins reminds us that, we're all human, we're all imperfect, but that's the best way to be!


---
class: content-even

# Retrain Your Brain
- Talk
- Be a mentor
- Assessments
- Learning and Development


???

- Being a mentor might seem insane - if you can't convince yourself you know what you are talking about, how in hell can you convince someone else?
 - But that's kind of the point
 - By taking the time to mentor someone else, and share with them what you _do_ know, you are proving to yourself (and your dumb brain) that actually you know alot more than it gives you credit for
 - And, remember there is a good chance they are thinking/feeling the same as you, that they don't know what they are doing - so by teaching them, and helping them skill up, you are actually giving them ammo to fight their own Impostor syndrome as well

---
class: content-even

# Retrain Your Brain
- Talk
- Be a mentor
- Assessments
- Learning and Development

???

- Remember we said your brain likes evidence? But it also likes to twist evidence?
 - Look at potential external assessments you can do - maybe that will be a short course with an exam at the end, or an industry-recognised certification
 - If you have data from an un-associated third party (one that, let's be honest, probably doesn't care if you pass or fail!), then your brain can't really twist that to fit it's narrative, and has to start accepting, maybe you do know something after all!
- Finally, learning and development - we'll come onto this shortly, but essentially, by learning new skils and undertaking personal development, you are proving to your brain that you must have the skills and knowledge required to learn new things

# Impostor Syndrome As A Superpower
![](impostor/images/success.png)

.reference[Human Vectors by Vecteezy (vecteezy.com/free-vector/human)]

???

- So far, we've looked at how impostor syndrome can negatively impact you, and how to overcome it
- However, it's not all bad
- There are actually a number of ways in which Impostor Syndrome can help you become your very own superhero!

---

class: content-odd

# Soft Skills

- Studies (Tewfik, B, 2021) have shown that individuals who experience impostor syndrome are considered to have better interpersonal skills, be more empathetic and be better facilitators and collaborators
- This may well be because we use those skills to hide the fact we are frauds (or at least, we think we are)

---

class: content-even

# Continually Improving Skills

.smallish[- Someone with impostor syndrome may spend more time trying to develop the skills they think they are missing
- Studies show that experiencing impostor syndrome drives diligence, hard work and desire to reach higher standards (Flett et al.,
1992) and (Stober & Childs, 2010).
- To someone with impostor syndrome, any amount of improvement probably never seems good enough, but we can harness this to maximse our development]

???

- When you think about it, it makes sense that someone who believes they are faking it and doesn't have the skills they need will spend contact hours trying to develop and build those skills
 - Studies find they still won't display those skills in public, but they're continually spending time trying practising their craft
- This can be dangerous, as impostor syndrome and perfectionism often go hand in hand, and holding yourself to an impossibly high standard is again giving your brain evidence that fits what it believes
 - and that is where our success log and external assessment comes in
- But what if we can harness that desire, maximise our ability to learn, and prove to our dumb brain that we are better than that, all at the same time?

# Power Up Your Learning

.withtitle[.smallish[- The often make is going 'too fast', trying to jump up the ladder as quickly as possible
- However, we actually gain the most from being in the 'sweet spot']]

.right[![](impostor/images/target.png)]

???

- If you feel you are missing skills, the danger is to try and learn everything all at once. However, it's important to learn in your 'sweet spot'
  
- Imagine that target represents your ability - right now you are in the red zone:
- Too easy (the middle), and no learning takes place
- At your current skill level re-enforces what you know, but doesn't help you improve
- Slightly harder (the ourter circle), builds upon what you already know, but in an achivable way
- Significantly harder (off the target) - you might struggle through it with help (depending on _how_ much harder it is), but you are not going to be able to learn from it

# Power Up Your Learning

.withtitle[.smallish[- The often make is going 'too fast', trying to jump up the ladder as quickly as possible
- However, we actually gain the most from being in the 'sweet spot']]

.right[![](impostor/images/target.png)]

???

- An example of this is learning to read - a child who knows the letters of the alphabet won't gain too much (other than confidence) by repeating the letters of the alphabet over and over.
- They are likewise not going to be able to go from knowing the individual letters to reading war and peace, no matter how much help they get.
- However, with a little bit of guidance and help from a teacher or an older student, could read words like 'dog' or 'cat'.

- This is called Vygotsky scaffolding (Vi - got - ski), where you can build upon your existing knowledge (and prove your existing knowledge to yourself at the same time) with a little assistance (be that a mentor, or a resource online for example) in incremental steps, like building scaffolding a layer at a time

- Remember, record all the learning you do in your achievement log, so that can can build up this 'portfolio of proof' to show your brain when it's trying to screw you over.

# Observations

- Please don't tell someone they have impostor syndrome
 - While well-intentioned, it often makes things worse
- There are other reasons individuals can feel like frauds
 - External discrimination or outdated views repeated often enough can be internalised
- There is an opposite of Impostor Syndrome - the Dunning-Kruger Effect!

???

- Something that can be very dangerous is telling someone they have impostor syndrome.
- Imagine a situation where someone is trying to do something really hard - way above their current level. They ask for help, saying they don't understand it and can't do it, but the response they get is "Oh, that's just impostor syndrome, you'll be fine".
 - Actually, in that situation they need help!! If someone trusts you enough to share their struggles with you, then help them cope, then help them retrain their brain, but please don't make an assumption first
- While way outside the scope of this talk, not all feelings of inadequacy or feelings of being a fraud are impostor syndrome - many minorities have been the subject of outdated views, for example, that when repeated often enough, can feel true to the individual involved
- In case anyone is wondering, there is an opposite of Impostor Syndrome - unfortunately we don't have time to talk about it right now, but let's just say the study that gave it it's name, the Dunning-Kruger effect came from a news report of a bank robber who covered his face in lemon juice, thinking it would hide his face in the same way it can be used as inivisble ink!!

---
class: summary-slide middle

Impostor syndrome is way more common than we realise - we see our peers as successful and high-achieving, when inside they might feel just the same as we do. Support each other on the bad days, and share in successes on the good.

Impostor syndrome is usually seen as bad - but using it as your superpower lets you prove to yourself that you are way more skilled than you give yourself credit for.
