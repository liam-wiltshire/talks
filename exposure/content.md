# Exposure Doesn't Pay The Bills
## <small>Career Advice I Wish I'd Been Given</small>

???

- Work. We all have to do it
- Doesn't mean we should live to work.
- Working 8 hours a day (hah), 5 days a week (double hah) means you spend 24% of your life at work
- If it's more like 55 hours a week, that's a third of your life
- So, let's make work work for you

# Exposure Doesn't Pay The Bills
## <small>Career Advice I Wish I'd Been Given</small>

???

- Before I go on, I just want to talk about how great it is t be here - 
- My role is full time remote - which is awesome, but it's so amazing to be able to spend time in person with friends, colleagues and people far far smarter than I am!!
- Running a conference is _hard_ - so many people are needed to make these things happens - organisers, sponsors, technical and more
- So from me, a personal thank you
- If you get an opportunity to speak to any of the organisers, let them know how much you appreciate it

- So, who am I?

# Why Do We Work?
.highres[![](exposure/images/question.png)]


???

- We spend alot of our time working - around half our waking hours
- We need to have a good reason to do it
- There are lots of valid reasons, and they will be different for all of us, but some of the common ones include:

---

class: section-title-a center centralimage
# Higher Levels Of Wellbeing
.highres[![](exposure/images/wellness.png)]

.bottomright[.xsmall[Yuan, L. 2022]]
???
- Psychologists such as Lily Yuan suggest that work improve our sense of wellbeing
 - Giving us a purpose or meaning, and giving us a sense of fulfilment as we achieve tasks successfully
 - For me this is seeing someone use Tebex 

---

class: section-title-b center centralimage
# Building Relationships
.highres[![](exposure/images/team.png)]

.bottomright[.xsmall[Yuan, L. 2022]]
???
- As humans, many of us want to build relationships with like-minded people
- Once such venue for that is work - working with people who are interested in similar things, have similar values etc is an effective way of building those relationships

---

class: section-title-c center centralimage
# Personal Growth
.highres[![](exposure/images/growth.png)]

.bottomright[.xsmall[Gupta, K. 2016]]
???
- Learning new skills and learning about ourselves as people is important for many people
- Work is a great opportunity to do this - improving our knowledge and skills 'on the job', work refining what is important to us

---

class: section-title-a center centralimage
# Recognition
.highres[![](exposure/images/success.png)]

.bottomright[.xsmall[Yuan, L. 2022]]
???
- Tying back into that sense of wellbeing, and also our personal growth, being recognised for our contribution to something bigger than ourselves is important for many people
- This might be internal recognition, industry awards (personally or part of a team), or just that sense of seeing someone using or playing something you've had a hand in making

---

class: section-title-b center centralimage
# Money
.highres[![](exposure/images/money.png)]

???
- We need to address the elephant in the room
- Of course, financial sustenance is probably the main reason for working for many of us
 - We have bills to pay, we need to feel and clothe ourselves and our families
- This doesn't always mean any job that pays the bills is the right one, but we can't overlook it.

---

class: section-title-c center centralimage

# Why Do YOU Work?
.highres[![](exposure/images/you.png)]


???

- These are just some of the many reasons why you might be working
- Everyone will have a whole bunch of reasons, and will put different weights on different factors
- When you have 5 minutes, list down your top reasons for working
- This is the _only_ way to know if your work is working for you.

# Jobs vs Career

.highres[![](exposure/images/job-career.png)]

???

- Are you in a job, or are you in a career?
- What's the difference?
- Sometimes we can feel like these words are interchangable, but actually they have very distinct meanings.
 - I'm not smart enough to know what they are though - so I found some people who did!!!

---

class: summary-slide middle

"A job is **something you do to earn money**, while a career is **something you pursue** that may or may not lead to financial stability"
.xsmall[CareerSmarter, 2023]

???
- "This is the first definition I found"
- READ QUOTE
- I'm not a big fan of this definition - a career that leaves you out on the street isn't a very good career!
 - But it does make a good point - oftentimes a job will be _just_ for the money, but a career is something more.
- "As I said, I wasn't a big fan, so I continued digging...."

---

class: summary-slide middle

"If your definition of a career makes it larger than a job, then your **mentality** toward it will be vastly different. You would go into any position for your career path as **something worth doing** despite any frustrations and roadblocks. It would be **something you enjoy doing, something with a lot of growth potential, and something you donâ€™t find yourself getting bored of** after a few years."
.xsmall[Jonus Group, 2023]

???

- READ QUOTE
- This feels more like it - a career feels like something worth doing - something you were born to do
 - This doesn't mean that a career is the same for everyone - one persons idea of a job might be someone elses dream career - but understanding where you are in your life helps you decide the direction you want to go in

# Job vs Career

- There isn't a right or a wrong 
- It depends on what YOU are looking for
 - And that will change over time!
- Most 'work' is a combination of both

???

- Despite what the media may say, there is no right or wrong - a career is no better or worse than 'just a job', they are just different things
- At different times in your life, what you want will change
 - My first job was just that - it was a job - I wanted money to go out, take my girlfriend on dates, and I didn't know what I wanted to do with the rest of my life
 - A few years into my 'career', I spent a year freelancing - I needed a break from working for a boss, from office politics. I took alot of work that wasn't important to me - it was a means to an end, but it gave me the mental space to reset, and re-scope what I wanted in my life because I wasn't invested

# Job vs Career

- There isn't a right or a wrong 
- It depends on what YOU are looking for
 - And that will change over time!
- Most 'work' is a combination of both

???

- It's important to recognise that what you want from your career - or indeed what your career actually is - might change over time:
- Story:
 - Spent most of my 'career' as a developer - or so I thought
 - Now I almost never touch code, none of my responsibilities are in technlogy - why?
 - Actually, my careers is 'solving problems' - it's only taken me 16 years to figure that out!!!
 - Code was a tool I used to solve problems - writing code was my job, solving problems is my career - "Wasn't the sort of person to spend hours learning about new design patterns, or keeping on top of the latest in the microservice vs monolith wars"
 - Now I use spreadsheets - I'll let you decide if that's better or worse!!

# So, What Have I Learned?
.highres[![](exposure/images/idea.png)]

???
- I've had jobs for over 20 years
- And a career for the last 16
- I've made major screw ups - both personally and progressionally - but I've also had moments that define me and shaped my life going forward
- Not everything here will apply to everyone - it depends on what is important to YOU, and where you are right now
- But if everyone can take one thing away from this, then I can spend the rest of my week happy!

# Be Your Own Cheerleader
.highres[![](exposure/images/cheerleader.png)]

???

- You achieve so much every single day
- However, it doesn't always get noticed
 - This usually isn't intentional - as a manager, I try to catch my team members doing great things, but with so much going on, it's not always easy
- As a Brit, I'm very poor at "blowing my own trumpet" (or horn), but it's something I've had to work on
 - Your work won't always speak for itself - document your wins, and make sure you share them when you get the opportunity (1:1s, annual reviews etc)

# Do the Role You Aspire to Do

.highres[![](exposure/images/act-leader.png)]

???

- When I first became a manager, I was promoted because I was good as a developer.....
 - I was a TERRIBLE manager - but back then it was quite common
- These days, I'm certainly seeing more of a trend to promote people who show leadership traits - it's not happening everywhere, but it's certainly happening more than it used to
- So, show you have the attributes to do the role you'd like to do - that doesn't mean you have to go round bossing people, but show you have the desire, you can think about the things that are important in that role...

# Do the Role You Aspire to Do

.highres[![](exposure/images/act-leader.png)]

???

- Story: When I first joined Tebex, I was hired as a developer - I knew I wanted more - CTO, leader in the company
- After 10 working days, I sent this:

---

class: content-odd center


.coverimg[![](exposure/images/email1.png)]

???

- An email with some pretty heavy suggestions about how things could be improved

---

class: content-odd center


.coverimg[![](exposure/images/email2.png)]

???

- Setting better expections, holding staff to account, providing support if they are being set up to fail etc
- In short, showing that I could think like a leader and a business owner
- It's something that in a company that isn't open to feedback could have got my fired, but for a company that wants to grow or improve... let's just say that a number of years later, Lee told me _this_ was the moment he knew that I would always try to act in the company's best interest, and that I could have a significant role in helping Tebex mature and scale.

# Know Your Value
.highres[![](exposure/images/contract.png)]

???

- What is value? (audience suggestions)
- Value is anything that is important to you that you are willing to trade your skills or time for
 - Obviously Money, but it might also be networking opportunities, skill development, being part of a well-known brand etc.
- Only YOU know what is valuable to you

---

class: content-even

# Know Your Value

- Being passionate about your work is great, but it's still a commercial transaction
- The only person who can decide what you are willing to trade your skills for is you
 - Not just cash

???

- Work is a trade - you are trading your skills, knowledge and experience for 'value' - this is cash most obviously, but also those other things that are important to you
- Cash is going to be a big part of the transaction, but what about work-life-balance?
- Or the opportunity to earn more down the line (equity)?
- Or learning skills that will help you progress your career in the direction you want - in particularly if you are changing direction


---

class: content-even

# Know Your Value

- "We know the salary is low, but it's great exposure!"
- "We work long hours, but you are making a massive difference to disadvanted children"
- "We pay the highest salaries in the industry, but you might be working 12-14 hour days"
- None of these are right or wrong, but you have to decide what is valuable to you, and how it needs to balance up

???

- In my first ever role, the salary was very low - (about 20% lower than similar roles in the same city), "because" they offered a ping-pong table/tournament, annual company weekend away etc.
- I was straight out of Uni, student loan repayments kicked in, really could have done with more salary.
- I wasn't a big fan of ping-pong, and the company holiday wasn't really my thing - that said, those same things _were_ definitely valuable to some of my colleagues, so it's not that those things are _wrong_, just not right for me
- But I didn't have a strong concept of my own value at the time (it was my first job), so I didn't push for pay-rises, and struggled along for the first couple of years
- Later in my career, those values changed slighty - when I joined Tebex, I actually took a slight pay-cut from my previous role, but this was because I valued other things:
 - Potential for bigger earnings in future
 - I was miserable in my current role, so was looking for work I would enjoy and people I would enjoy spending my workday with
 - The opportunity to get into a high-growth industry, learning about the inner workings of the industry.

# Own Your ~~Mitsakes~~ Mistakes
.highres[![](exposure/images/embarrised.png)]

???

- I thought about making a CrowdStrike reference here - but maybe it's too soon!!
- I'm far, far, far from perfect - I have made huge mistakes in my Career....
 - I once updated an entire production database to set every product at 5 dollars
 - I've copied a client into an email thread where we talked about dropping them as a client
 - And many others besides!
- However, I've always been upfront, and honest to ensuring the right people knew about it
 - But more than that, I've always presented a way to solve it

---
class: content-odd

# Own Your Mistakes

- Everyone is going to make mistakes
- Be the person with the reputation for honesty - the person others can trust
- And be the person with the reputation for fixing those mistakes - not just making it someone else's problem

# Your Work Should Work For You
.highres[![](exposure/images/work-balance.png)]

???

- Once you know your values, you should stop and ask yourself one question...

---

class: section-title-b center

# "Am I in the right job for me?"
.highres[![](exposure/images/question2.png)]


???

- "Am I in the right job for me?"
- mentally, financially, culturally, intellectually
- What are your Goals? Where do you want to be in 3 months? 1 year? 3 years?
- If the role you are in now isn't moving you towards your goals, then it's moving you away from them

# "What Does Your Company Owe You?"

- Value
- Respect
- A Safe Place To Work
- Honesty
- Support/Attention
- Fairness

???

- Remember, work is a commercial transaction - the company you work for should be doing what it can to ensure you want to continue working there
 - It's far more expensive to recruit than to retain!
- Know what you deserve - you deserve good value in exchange for your skills and time, you deserve to be treated with respect, like an adult
- You deserve to be safe at work, and in an enviroment where you know where you stand, your route to progression (or not), and support and attention to help you grow
- And most of all, to be treated fairly in the above.


---

class: section-title-c

# "What Does Your Company Owe You?"

- Value
- Respect
- A Safe Place To Work
- Honesty
- Support/Attention
- Fairness

???

- Story - Overwolf - as leaders, what is expected of us ingrains this into the core of our responsibilities:
- "Unleash Potential", "Empower our People", "Proactive and Responsive", "Allow & Accommodate Conflict"

- We are open and honest with all of our team - I've never worked at an organisation before that shares the content of board decks, financial statements etc in the depth that happens at Overwolf.

class: section-title-a

# What Do You Owe Your Company?

- Perform your duties to the best of your ability
- Focus and effort
- Integrity

???

- By the same token, your company will have some reasonable expectations of what you owe them in return
- Clearly, performing your job to the best of your ability is the major one, but there is more than that
- While you are at work, being focused on the task at hand and dedicating your effort to it - obviously no-one is perfect - I will openly admit there are days where I'm not firing on all cylindars, but focus and effort should be the norm
- Your integrity - protecting company assets and data, being honest and respectful in dealings with colleagues, suppliers, customers.

---

class: section-title-b

# What DON'T You Owe Your Company?

- Health
- Personal Life
- Unearned Loyalty

???

- Setting boundaries is hard, but vital to have work that works for you
- You do not owe your company your health - working to exhaustion, through illness etc doesn't help you
- Likewise, you don't owe them your personal life - working occassional overtime is one thing, working until 11pm every night to be back at 6am the next day is something else
- One of my favourite phrases at work is "there are things more important than work" - Health and Family are definitely the two at the top of my list!

---

class: section-title-b

# What DON'T You Owe Your Company?

- Health
- Personal Life
- Unearned Loyalty

???

- Loyalty is tricky - it's common to hear "You don't owe your employer Loyalty", and that's partly true, but I prefer to see that loyalty must be earned.
 - If your company has supported you during a long illness, bereavement or similar, handing your notice in the day you go back and trying to take other staff of customers with you might be a bit of a dick move!!
- But you certainly shouldn't stay in a role just because you feel bad for leaving your colleagues to pick up the slack, or because the company hired you when you were looking - they hired you becaue they needed you just as much as you needed them! 

---
class: summary-slide middle

- Work is something that most of us have to do, but it certainly shouldn't be a one way street.
 - Only YOU can decide what matters to you - what matters now might be different in the future.
 - Helping progress personal and professional goals - learning, relationships, money or anything else
- Work is a commercial transacton - you owe your focus, integrety and effort, but they need to work hard so that you _want_ to be there!


???
- Work is something that most of us have to do, but it certainly shouldn't be a one way street.
- Before you can answer if a job is right or wrong, if you are on the right career path or not, you need to decide what matters to you
 - And what matters now might not be what matters in 1 years, or 5 years, so make sure you take stock of what you want regularly.
- You should be driving your personal and work goals forward - be your own cheerleader, be aware of your own value, and work towards the role you strive for.
- Work is a commercial transaction - know what you and your company owe each other, and what you don't.
- Be brave, Be bold, Be awesome.
